# ConwaysGameOfLife

# left click to mark a cell alive, right click to kill the cell

# left arrow to slow the FPS, right arrow to double the FPS(if the world is small enough)

# change the random_world flag to True to start from a completely random world

# the world implements a wrapping feature, so a cell in the top left corner will have neighbors on all 4 corners. Cells on the top row can see its neighbors on the bottom row, the cells on the left border can see its neighbors on the right border and vice versa. This allows gliders to run forever!
